Implementation of Bitmap library.
---------------------------------
Getting Started Guide

1. Install the following packages to build and test.
    a. Cunit -- Unit Test frame work for automated testing.
    b. CPPCheck -- Static Analysis.
    c. Valgrind -- Test memory related issues.
2. make 
        -- build the library bitmap.o and link it with test/bitmap_basic_test.c
        -- The binary executable thus created is bitmaptest_basic.
3. make testall 
        -- Does a static analysis using CPPCheck on the code base.
        -- builds the executable bitmaptest_basic
        -- Uses CUnit framework to test all unit test cases.
        -- Uses Valgrind to test possible memory issues 
           when unit test framework is running.
4. When bitmaptest_basic is run, the log files are reidrected to /tmp 
   the location is printed for reference as well with a random extension everytime.
